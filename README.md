# AWS Nano

A dependency-free AWS Java 8 client (ultimate goal)

NOTE: *Work in progress; incomplete!*

Currently: very initial S3 support and skeletal, non-functional Java 8 NIO FileSystem module.

Short term work will be towards enough S3 support for the filesystem, then fleshed out S3 support.

Eventually, selected other API's will likely be supported, particularly, EC2, Lambda, and
CloudFormation.
